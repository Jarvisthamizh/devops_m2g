Description: >
    This template contains the security groups required by our entire stack.
    We create them in a seperate nested template, so they can be referenced
    by all of the other nested templates.

Resources:

    # This security group defines who/where is allowed to access the Application Load Balancer.
    # By default, we've opened this up to the public internet (0.0.0.0/0) but can you restrict
    # it further if you want.

    # This security group defines who/where is allowed to access the ECS hosts directly.
